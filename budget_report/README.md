**Welcome to Folio Budget Report!**

This program is intended to take the invoice data exported from the FOLIO
desktop client in the form of a CSV file, extract the relevant columns of
information, and process the data in order to generate a monthly XLSX budget
report for the library. It does not directly interface with the FOLIO client
API; rather, it takes the raw data exported from FOLIO and processes it
locally.
