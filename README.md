# pickler-dev-truman
A repository to track progress and possibly deploy tools related to Pickler Memorial Library, Truman State University.

***PLEASE NOTE:*** Many functions are shared across the different projects (e.g. `login_folioclient()`, `error_msg()`, etc.). The conscious decision was made to copy-paste the entire functions and directly write them in the main files for each project as it would keep each project separate and not rely on "external" dependencies. This is a monorepo through Github only; development was conducted locally on a Windows machine, with each folder being in a separate location on the machine; this Github repository is here as a back-up in case anything should happen to the local machine as well as to transfer development files between computers. The change may be made in the future to combine these into a shared root import package, but at the time of writing this is not the case.
