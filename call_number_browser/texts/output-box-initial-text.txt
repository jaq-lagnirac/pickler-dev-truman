-------------------------------PROGRAM OUTPUT GOES HERE------------------------------

This tool will work with Library of Congress (LC) and Dewey Decimal
Classification numbers. However, more testing has been conducted on LC numbers,
and LC numbers appear to make up a majority of the materials that are at the
institution of development (Pickler Memorial Library).

Please make sure that config.json or another configuration JSON file exists,
either in the same working directory as the executable (the default) or listed
by the "Path to configuration file" field.

For more information, please click "Info/Help", read other documentation,
or contact Pickler Memorial Library's Technical Services and Systems
at Truman State University, Kirksville, MO.
