**Welcome to Mobius Label Generator!**

This program is intended as an open source generator to create labels to help 
facilitate interlibrary loans within the MOBIUS Linking Libraries Consortium.
The tool takes a template PDF given by the user (created using an external
tool&mdash;such as
[LibreOffice Writer](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/)&mdash;with
standard 8.5"x11" landscape letter dimensions) and generates a label sheet PDF
for use and printing on a standard 8.5"x11" portrait letter 4x2 sticker sheet.

This project was developed using [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/) for
use and future development on Windows.
