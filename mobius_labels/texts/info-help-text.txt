PURPOSE:
This program is intended as an open source generator to create labels to help 
facilitate interlibrary loans within the MOBIUS Linking Libraries Consortium.
The tool takes a template PDF given by the user (created using an external
tool--such LibreOffice Writer--with standard 8.5"x11" landscape letter
dimensions) and generates a label sheet PDF for use and printing on a 4x2 
sticker sheet.

TEMPLATE PDF:
The tool requires a user-inputted PDF (relative or absolute) path. The default
name of the file is "mobius_label.pdf", stored in the same working directory
as the tool. This path can be changed with the relevant field. At minimum,
the PDF must have the following fields (labeled using an external tool):
    - "Title" : The title of the piece of medium, FOLIO includes the author
        in this field on occasion.
    - "CallNumber" : The call number of the item.
    - "SendTo" : The intended destination of the item.
    - "Patron" : An anonymized patron code, the intended recipient of the item.
    - "Location" : The shelving location of the requested item.
    - "LibCode" : The MOBIUS Library Code from the config.json file (See
        CONFIGURATION FILE).
    - "SuppliedBy" : The address of the sender of the item from the config.json
        file (See CONFIGURATION FILE).
Please note: The generator is case-sensitive. Only include what is in between
the quotation marks part of the labels and not the marks themselves. Please
visit the repository for an example mobius_label.pdf as well as an editable 
template DOCX.

CONFIGURATION FILE:
The tool requires a configuration file stored in the Javascript Object Notation
format (JSON). The default name of the file is "config.json", stored in the
same working directory as the tool. This path can be changed with the relevant
field. At minimum, the JSON must have the following keys and values:
    - "okapi_url" : The URL to the OKAPI gateway to the FOLIO project,
        will most likely be "https://okapi-mobius.folio.ebsco.com".
    - "tenant" : The tenant ID for the institution.
    - "username" : The individual user of the institution.
    - "password" : The password for the associated account.
    - "lib_code" : The MOBIUS Library Code, typically 4-6 letters for MOBIUS
        members
    - "supplied_by" : The address of the sender. Can contain up to a 4-line
        address, with each line separated by a newline character ("\n").
Please note: The generator is case-sensitive. Only include what is in between
the quotation marks part of the labels and not the marks themselves. Please
visit the repository for an editable template config.json file.

OFFSETS:
The tool is capable on printing a full sheet of 8 labels as well as printing on
used sheets (i.e. sheets that do not have a full 8 stickers) by using the
"offset" field. A small graphic appears on the main window to aid in 
determining the offset that will be inputted into the program, where X denotes
the labels that will be printed based on a vertical orientation (with blanks
denoting no label will be printed there).

CREDITS AND CLOSING:
Developed for use and further development on Windows using Python 3.12+.

This tool was commissioned by Stephen Wynn, the Associate Dean of Libraries for
Technical Services & Systems of Pickler Memorial Library at Truman State
University and developed by Justin Caringal of Truman State University.
