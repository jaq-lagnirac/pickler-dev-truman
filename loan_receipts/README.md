**Welcome to Pickler Loan Receipts!**

This program is intended as an interface to quickly and efficiently print
out check-out loan receipts through a standard thermal receipt printer to
patrons of Pickler Memorial Library at Truman State University. The tool takes
an input Patron ID and sends a print request to a connected printer. This
program was built for internal/in-house usage and not originally intended for
further use beyond Pickler to the wider MOBIUS Consortium.
